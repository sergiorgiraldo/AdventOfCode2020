    # we need to find a number such that the remainders of all the buses are consecutive after N departures
    # suppose we have 3 buses: 3, 5, 7. After N departures, from perspective of the third bus, time elapsed is 7N 
    # from 2nd bus perspective, to win the gold coin, it left at 7N - 1, so the remainder of 7N divided by 5 is 1
    # from 1st bus perspective, to win the gold coin, it left at 7N - 2, so the remainder of 7N divided by 3 is 2

    # from the example, bus 19 leaves at t=1068788 -> 56252 * 19
    #                   bus 31 leaves at t=1068787 -> 34477 * 31 + 1 (1068788 / 31 gives remainder 1)
    #                   bus 59 leaves at t=1068786 -> 18115 * 59 + 2 (1068788 / 59 gives remainder 2)

    # the **Chinese remainder theorem** states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of 
    # an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by 
    # the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime (no two divisors 
    # share a common factor other than 1).
